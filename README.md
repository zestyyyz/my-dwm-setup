dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.


dmenu - dynamic menu
====================
dmenu is an efficient dynamic menu for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dmenu you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------

(if necessary as root):

    make clean install

slstatus - suckless status
==========================
slstatus is a suckless status monitor for window managers that use WM_NAME
(e.g. dwm) or stdin to fill the status bar.


Features
--------
- Battery percentage/state/time left
- CPU usage
- CPU frequency
- Custom shell commands
- Date and time
- Disk status (free storage, percentage, total storage and used storage)
- Available entropy
- Username/GID/UID
- Hostname
- IP address (IPv4 and IPv6)
- Kernel version
- Keyboard indicators
- Keymap
- Load average
- Network speeds (RX and TX)
- Number of files in a directory (hint: Maildir)
- Memory status (free memory, percentage, total memory and used memory)
- Swap status (free swap, percentage, total swap and used swap)
- Temperature
- Uptime
- Volume percentage
- WiFi signal percentage and ESSID


Requirements
------------
Currently slstatus works on FreeBSD, Linux and OpenBSD.
In order to build slstatus you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (slstatus is installed into the
/usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install slstatus (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running slstatus
----------------
See the man page for details.


Configuration
-------------
slstatus can be customized by creating a custom config.h and (re)compiling the
source code. This keeps it fast, secure and simple.


Upcoming
--------

A release (v1.0) will come soon... ;)
After a long phase of inactivity, development has been continued!


st - simple terminal
--------------------
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.


Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info
